The basic idea behind JWT:
* Front-end communicates with back-end through requests and back-end sends nack responses.
* The back-end would like to know who is talkign to them and what kind of permissions the one
  talking to them has.
* That's when JWT comes into play.
* When the user first logs in with their credentials, back-end gives them an Access Token and a
  Refresh token.
* Front-end stores these tokens and includes them whenever it sends later requests.
* The access token will prove the identity of the sender, but it has short living time. This is
  for situations where the token is leaked, and we want the access token to expire quickly, so 
  the attacker cannot use the access token for long.
* Refresh token has longer living time. When the access token has expired, it used to generate new
  access token.
* When the refresh token has expired, the user is required to log in again with their credentials.
* In this way, the back-end can verify users without asking them to log in again and again.

Django serializers:
* Django uses ORM (Object Relational Mapping).
* It maps Python objects to corresponding code that needs to be executed to make a change in the
  databases.
* In other words, when you create a class(model), a table is created in the database. When you created an
  object, a row is created in the database. When you created an attribute, a column is created in
  the database. So, in a way, ORM translates code/object to queries.
* A serializer in Django REST Framework converts Python objects into JSON for responses, and 
  converts incoming JSON into Python objects while validating the data.

API models:
* They define what data exists and how they are stored.
* They define the structure of the data, including fields and their types.
* So, when we created a model, it's like we have created a table in the database

API views:
* They are back-end endpoints that define how the server reacts to HTTP requests. (they are logic)
* TokenObtainPairView and TokenRefreshView are built-in view that we can use right away.

Relation between models - views - serializers:
* For requests:
Client (JSON)
   ↓
View (API endpoint)
   ↓
Serializer (validate + translate)
   ↓
Model (save/query DB)
* For responses:
Model (query DB)
   ↓
Serializer (translate)
   ↓
View (API endpoint)
   ↓
Client (JSON)
* We create the thing (model) -> translate it to JSON and vice versa(serilizer) -> create what
  action we can do to the thing or how it behaves (view)


Creation of databases steps:
* In terminal, first command: python manage.py makemigrations
* This command will detect changes in the models.py (new model, new field, removed fiels etc.) and
  generate migration files. These files are python code that describes the plan of what to change
  in the database.--> Can think the command as: Write down instructions for how the DB should change
* Second command: python manage.py migrate
* This command applies migrations to the database. What it does: reads the migration files, executes
  SQL, creates/updates tables, records applied migrations in django_migrations table

Run server command: python manage.py runserver

=====================================

Access token and refresh token is saved in local storage of the browser.

Axios:
* Axios is a popular HTTP client library for making requests. It checks if there is an access
  token stored in the local storage of the browser. If there is, it adds the token to request 
  headers.
* This way, we don't have to manually add tokens everytime we make a request.

JSX:
* JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML in React. JSX makes it easier to write
  and add HTML in React.

Route vs. Endpoint:
* Usually is interchangeable.
* Route: Rule in server that says: when this URL + HTTP method is requested, run this code.
  Example: path("api/tasks/", TaskListView.as_view())
    URL path: /api/tasks/
    Method(s): GET, POST
    Handler: TaskListView
* Endpoint: The exposed API location that a client can call to perform an action.
  Example: GET /api/tasks/  -->  Retrieve a list of tasks
